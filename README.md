A habit building app: Habit Helper

Problem Statement: Building habits can be hard

Our solution: Modern aesthetic habit tracker with science backed methods and solutions (App)

Science Behind a Habit
To build a habit you need to:
    Lower activation energy
     - Via cues (for your brain. Like “every time this happens then i do this”
     - Cravings (try to link it to something you already do)
     - Ease (instead of reading 30 minutes, a habit should be reading one page)
     - Reward (make it satisfying/rewarding to follow through with your habit)
    Atomic habits are small actions that lead into larger goals
    
Cognitive Load Theory - Willpower is a limited resource, can’t build many habits at once
    Limit 2 habits at a time
Social Contract Theory - The American Society of Training and Development (ASTD) found that If people have a specific accountability appointment (like your text message implies), that chance of them doing the task rises to 95%.
    Sends a message to your friend if you miss a day
