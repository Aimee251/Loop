# Loop 🔁
*A science-backed habit builder designed to help habits actually stick.*

---

## Inspiration

It’s the start of a new year—and with it, countless new resolutions. Many people aim to improve their lives by building healthy and productive habits, yet most fail due to lack of support, motivation, or sustainable design.

We built **Loop** to change that.

Instead of simply tracking habits, Loop uses **scientifically backed behavior-change principles** to maximize the chances that users successfully build and maintain their desired habits.

---

## What It Does

Loop is a habit-building app that goes beyond traditional trackers by actively supporting users through behavioral science.

In addition to core habit features such as goal setting and progress tracking, Loop introduces **three key science-driven mechanisms**:

### 🧠 Accountability (Social Contract Theory)

Each habit can be linked to an **accountability person**.

- Automatic SMS updates are sent based on habit performance  
- People are significantly more likely to follow through when they don’t want to disappoint others  
- Grounded in **Social Contract Theory**

---

### ⚡ Dynamic Goals (Activation Energy Theory)

Users log their mood each day, and **Gemini-powered AI** dynamically adjusts habit goals.

- Lower effort goals on low-energy days  
- Higher targets when users feel capable  
- Reduces friction to getting started  

Based on **Activation Energy Theory**, which shows people are more likely to act when effort is minimized.

---

### 🧩 Habit Limits (Cognitive Load Theory)

Users can build a maximum of **3 habits at a time**.

- Willpower is a limited resource  
- Fewer simultaneous habits increase success rates  

This decision is informed by **Cognitive Load Theory**.

---

### 👥 Group Habit Mode

Loop also supports **group habit building**.

- A habit is only completed if **everyone** completes it for the day  
- Encourages real-world accountability  
- Creates meaningful reward and consequence systems beyond software
